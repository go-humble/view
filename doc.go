// Package view is a small library for organizing view-related code written in pure go
// which compiles to javascript via gopherjs (https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).
// View includes a View interface and some helper functions for operating on views
// (e.g. Append, Replace, Remove, AddEventListener, etc.). View works great as a
// stand-alone package or in combination with other Humble packages
// (https://github.com/go-humble).
//
// Version 0.3.0
//
// For the full source code, a getting started guide, and more information visit
